# Config Maps

Config maps are a feature of Kubernetes we can use to store configuration
parameters that pods running on the cluster can access at runtime.  A config
map can be filled with data coming from different sources:

* A Yaml dictionary in a `.yaml` file
* A file on disk containing one key per line with the format: `my.settings.key=myval`
* A directory containing configuration files in the same format as previous bullet
* From the command line as args for `kubectl`

Once a **ConfigMap** resource containing our data is created, a pod can use it in two
different ways:

1. By mounting a volume (a file will be created in the podâ€™s volume for each config key)
1. By injecting environment variables in the pod, each value will be stored in an env var
   named after the key

## Exercise n.1: config a Pod

> Change directory into the folder `definitions` before running the commands.

First of all, we need to create the **ConfigMap** resource:
```sh
kubectl apply -f myconfig.yaml
```

You can inspect the contents of the config map by running:
```sh
kubectl describe configmap my-config
```

We can now use it from a pod by mounting a volume (see the definition file):
```sh
kubectl apply -f nginx-configmap-pod.yaml
```

At this point, we can verify the pod can actually access the configuration
values:
```sh
$ kubectl exec -it nginx-configmap -- bash
$$ ls /etc/config
password  username
$$ cat /etc/config/username ; echo
root
$$ cat /etc/config/password ; echo
mypass
```
